# SmartTicket

SmartTicket is a project that aims to develop a system based on artificial intelligence for the automatic classification and prioritization of service tickets generated by users of a taxi application. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning models, the system analyzes user messages to predict the category of the reported issue and assign a priority based on the severity of the issue.

## Features

- **Automatic Ticket Classification**: Leverages deep learning models to classify service tickets into predefined categories such as "Payment Problems", "Security Problems", and "Lost and Found".
- **Priority Assignment**: Automatically assigns a priority level (e.g., "Immediate", "High", "Urgent") based on the predicted category, enabling customer service teams to focus on critical issues.
- **Historical Data Training**: The classification model is trained on historical data from manually tagged tickets, ensuring accuracy and relevance in predictions.
- **Scalable System**: Built with scalability in mind, allowing for easy integration into existing customer service workflows within a taxi application.

## Technology Stack

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: To process and understand user messages.
- **Deep Learning**: For accurate classification and prioritization of service tickets.
- **TensorFlow & Keras**: Frameworks used to build and train the machine learning models.
- **Flask**: Web framework used to create the user interface for operators to interact with the system.

## Getting Started

To get started with SmartTicket, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SmartTicket.git
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Train the model (if needed)**:
   Load the historical data and run the training script to generate the classification model.

4. **Run the Flask application**:
   ```bash
   python interfaz.py
   ```

5. **Access the application**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to start using the system.
